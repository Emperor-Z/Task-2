YOUR NEXT STEP: WRITE THE REPORT
================================================================================

File: REPORT_OUTLINE.md

This file provides the structure for your 750-1000 word reflective report.

The report should address 6 main sections:

1. DESIGN & ARCHITECTURE JUSTIFICATION
   - Explain why you chose weighted undirected graph + adjacency list
   - Why this beats alternatives (trees, matrices)
   - Why it's the right choice for this problem

2. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
   - O(1) pair lookup — explain why
   - O(E log E) ranking — explain why
   - Use benchmark data as evidence
   - Show how theory matches practice

3. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED
   - Why NOT use Apriori (frequent itemset mining)
   - Why NOT use customer hierarchy trees
   - Why NOT use dense adjacency matrix
   - Explain tradeoffs for each

4. SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
   - How would design handle 1 million transactions?
   - Where would bottlenecks appear?
   - What optimizations could you add?
   - Memory vs speed tradeoffs

5. EVIDENCE FROM CODE
   - Cite benchmark numbers (0.000088 ms, 212k tx/sec)
   - Reference test results (34/34 passing)
   - Show git history (atomic commits)
   - Explain what this proves about your design

6. KEY INSIGHTS & LESSONS
   - What did you learn?
   - What surprised you?
   - How would you approach similar problems?

================================================================================
HOW TO WRITE THE REPORT
================================================================================

STEP 1: Open REPORT_OUTLINE.md
        Read all 6 sections carefully
        Understand the structure

STEP 2: Gather Evidence
        Run: python benchmarks/run.py
        Copy: 0.000088 ms, 212,529 tx/sec, 0.023 sec, 34/34 tests
        Reference git commit SHAs from: git log --oneline

STEP 3: Write Introduction (1-2 paragraphs)
        State your design choice clearly
        Preview the main arguments

STEP 4: Write Sections 1-4 (3-4 paragraphs each)
        Justify each major design decision
        Use data and examples
        Explain the "why", not just the "what"

STEP 5: Write Conclusion (1-2 paragraphs)
        Tie everything together
        Emphasize that design is correct, fast, and scalable
        Show how evidence supports your choices

STEP 6: Edit and Refine
        Target: 750-1000 words
        Check: No rambling, every sentence serves a purpose
        Proofread: Grammar, spelling, clarity

ESTIMATED TIME: 2-3 hours

================================================================================
REPORT WRITING TIPS
================================================================================

✅ DO:
   - Use concrete numbers from benchmarks
   - Reference your code by file/function name
   - Explain "why" before "how"
   - Give examples (e.g., "top vegetables + milk pairs")
   - Cite your tests as proof of correctness
   - Discuss real-world scalability (1M transactions)

❌ DON'T:
   - Just describe what the code does (everyone can read code)
   - List features without justifying design
   - Ignore alternatives ("we didn't consider other approaches")
   - Make claims without evidence (prove with benchmarks)
   - Go over 1000 words (concise is better)
   - Include large code blocks (reference file names instead)

💡 STRUCTURE EXAMPLE:

"This system uses a weighted undirected graph represented as an adjacency 
list. This design choice was deliberate: pair lookup must be O(1) for 
interactivity (benchmark shows 0.000088ms), which graph.py provides via 
dict access. Alternatives like dense matrices would waste O(V²) memory, 
while tree hierarchies would require multiple traversals. With 14,963 
transactions producing 6,260 edges, the adjacency list is both memory 
efficient and fast."

(This paragraph: justifies design, cites evidence, explains tradeoff, 
shows understanding — ~95 words)
